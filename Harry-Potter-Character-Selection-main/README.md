# Harry Potter Character Selection

In this exercise you will be creating functions that will manipulate the style and the text of this HTML page. Use the information that you have learned from Period 1 and 2 to complete this assignment.

NOTE: the goal for this exercise is to ONLY create & edit JavaScript. Leave the HTML and CSS files alone.

## Directions

✔️- Create a new JavaScript file called scripts.js. The HTML file already has the script tag.

✔️ 1. Create a function called addTitle(), which will find the h1 element and add the following text inside of it: "Harry Potter Character Selection".

✔️ 2. Create a function called flexIt(), which should find the first element with the class called 'needFlex' and add the class flexIt to that element and then toggle the flexIt class on and off each time that function is called by the user clicking the button that says "Flex houses".

3. Create a function called addHouses(), which will find all the paragraphs that have a class called "description" and will set another class name. The new class name should be the name of the Hogwarts house the text is describing. Example: If the paragraph is about Ravenclaw, find that paragraph and set the class attribute to include ravenclaw as the 2nd class.

4. Create a function called emphasize() with one parameter called house. When the user clicks the button labeled with one of the four Hogwarts houses, your function applies the CSS styling associated with the .emphasis class to both the paragraph that describes that house and the people listed below that belong to that house. 

Example: When you have the HTML file open in the browser, if the user clicks the Gryffindor button at the top, the description of the Gryffindor house and the people in Gryffindor from the list at the bottom will all have blue backgrounds and yellow borders around them. When the user clicks that Gryffindor button again, the styling should disappear.

Bonus: Create a new function called hideTheSnitch() that makes the words "The Snitch" appear and disappear.  To do this, you can adjust the element's display attribute to be either "none" or not.
